## Project Name: Press Sports App Retention and Engagement Analysis 

## Project Description: Press Sports App users share an environment to engage with others who share similar interests [Drew write something marketing-y here]

## Research Questions to be Asked: 
With the advent of social media and sports, what are the correlations between active and inactive users? Are they different per sport? Does the network that athlete creates drive engagement and retention? Does the multi-sport athlete engage more with others or does a single-sport athlete engage with others at a higher level?

## Data set to be used: TBD
